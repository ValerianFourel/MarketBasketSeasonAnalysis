This is the repository for the Medium article on the Apriori Algorithm and how to test for statistically significance in changes seen in the Rules encoded by the Apriori
Algorithm for Consumer Behaviour. Here we study season specifically. 

We can find the article at: https://medium.com/@valerian.fourel/market-basket-analysis-algorithm-change-in-consumer-behaviour-across-seasons-b09da53c35b9

We can find the code written for exploratory Data Analysis, of the subject, as well as the code to interpret the results.
